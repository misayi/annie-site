		<h1>Who’s Annie?</h1>
		<p>Powered by at least two cups of coffee a day, I am an interactive designer who loves good user experience, information architecture, and beautiful interfaces. In my earlier career as a front-end developer, I discovered that my real passion is in design rather than development alone. By combining my knowledge and skills in both, I have created many successful marketing campaigns for a wide range of clients across many industries.</p>
		<p>I was born in Shanghai and have lived in many places around the world and within the States. I honestly love what I do and am the happiest when I get to flex my creative muscles. In addition to designing websites and mobile apps, I love running around taking portraits, baking sweet treats for the office, drawing anime-style illustrations, and following the eSports scene.</p>
		<p>I always want to use my talents and skills to create wonderful things for the world, and I’m always looking to innovate and improve. Let’s see what amazing things I can help you accomplish.</p>
